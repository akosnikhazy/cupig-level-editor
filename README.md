# cupig-level-editor
A small JavaScript level editor for my game in development, to make my work easier.

You can try it here: https://akosnikhazy.github.io/cupig-level-editor/
I do not explain it as it is for my game project and it is there for me to use it. But I had fun creating it so might as well share it.
